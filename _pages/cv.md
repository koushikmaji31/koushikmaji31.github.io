## Projects

### TPP Flow: A Flow-Matching Perspective for Temporal Point Process
- **Technologies:** Python, GenAI, PyTorch  
- **Project Code**  
- **Duration:** May 2024 – Present  
- **Description:**  
  - Master's Thesis Project under Prof. Srijith P.K., Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Hyderabad.  
  - Introduced a novel framework applying flow-matching principles to both discrete and continuous domains of Temporal Point Processes.  
  - Addressed limitations of traditional autoregressive models by reducing error accumulation in long sequences.  
  - Achieved MMD of 0.358 (SOTA) and a Wasserstein distance of 2.52 (SOTA = 2.42) on the Taxi Dataset forecast.  
  - Demonstrated competitive performance with approximately 4x faster sampling speed on one Taxi dataset.

### Unit Extractor – Fullstack Unit Extraction WebApp
- **Technologies:** Python, FastAPI, Transformers, JavaScript, OCR  
- **Project Code**  
- **Duration:** Sep 2024 – Present  
- **Description:**  
  - Developed a full-stack application for the Amazon ML Challenge 2024 featuring a drag-and-drop interface.  
  - Integrated an ML backend using EasyOCR for text extraction, MiniCPM-Llama3-V-2_5 as a knowledge base with a prompt-based framework, and a regex parser for precise entity extraction.  
  - Achieved an F1 score of approximately 71% using a minimal model for faster inference and enabled parallelization for large-scale use.  
  - Backend built with FastAPI and hosted via ngrok for external access.

### Enhancing MNIST Image Generation: VAEs with GMM to Avoid KL Divergence
- **Technologies:** Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)  
- **Project Code**  
- **Duration:** Mar 2024 – May 2024  
- **Description:**  
  - Final Project for the course PH6130 Data Science Analysis.  
  - Proposed a novel approach using a contrastive loss to form clusters in the latent space of MNIST images.  
  - Introduced Grassian Mixture Model fitting in post-training to eliminate KL divergence, reducing redundant generations by 30% and improving sample diversity and quality.

### Comparison Between CNN and GAN Architecture for Image Super-Resolution
- **Technologies:** GenAI, GAN, CNN  
- **Thesis Report**  
- **Duration:** Jan 2022 – May 2022  
- **Description:**  
  - Master's Thesis Project under Prof. P.S. Rao, Dept. of Mathematics and Computing, IIT Dhanbad.  
  - Compared CNN (SRCNN) and GAN (SRGAN) architectures for image super-resolution.  
  - Evaluated performance using PSNR, noting that SRCNN achieved higher PSNR while SRGAN delivered visually superior results.  
  - Explored the trade-off between quantitative metrics (PSNR) and perceptual quality.
